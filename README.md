# Fibonacci

This is my first project being uploaded to Github. I had an assessment where I had to desipher what the code meant.
I found out it calculated the fibonacci Sequence for the nth number.

Seeing that the code had an exponential complexity, I have tried to improve it by using the Golden Ratio.
I worked out that the largest fibonacci number you could get was the 1,476th. 
After that Python didn't have enough digits to calculate the 1,477th term as it defaulted to infinity.

All the while it taking <1s to calculate.


In comparison, the original fibonacci algorythm took over 75 minutes to calculate the 50th term in the sequence.
